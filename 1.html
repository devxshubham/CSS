    <h2>labrador</h2>
    <p>
        The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reteriver" >Retriever</a> is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly, outgoing, and
        high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large
        dog. The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the
        shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate.

    <h2>german shepherd</h2>
    <p>
        Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of
        noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog
        lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline,
        presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can
        turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of
        canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to
        learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German
        Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness
        that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.
